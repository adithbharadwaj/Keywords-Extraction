# Term Frequency (TF)

<p> 
The tf part
The tf-formula is a ratio of a termâ€™s occurences in a document and the number of occurences of the most frequent word within 
the same document.

<p>
 it represents the inverse of the share of the documents in which the regarded term can be found
</p>

# TF-IDF

The TF-IDF score of a word is the product of the TF(term frequency) and the IDF(inverse document frequence)
</p>

# Keywords Extraction

<p>
The most important words (keywords) from a document can be extracted by the tf-idf scores of the words.
the words with high tf-idf scores are more important than the words wit lower tf-idf scores.
